# wgparry: cross-platform GPU collision-detection

**/!\ This library is still under heavy development and is still missing many features.**

The goal of **wgparry** is to especially be "**parry** on the gpu". It aims (but it isnâ€™t there yet) to expose
geometric operations (collision-detection, ray-casting, point-projection, etc.) as composable WGSl shaders and kernels.
