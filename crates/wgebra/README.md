# wgebra − composable WGSL shaders for linear algebra

**/!\ This library is still under heavy development and is still missing many features.**

The goal of **wgebra** is to especially be "**nalgebra** on the gpu". It aims (but it isn’t there yet) to expose linear
algebra operations (including BLAS-like and LAPACK-like operations) as well as geometric types (quaternions,
similarities, etc.) as composable WGSl shaders and kernels.
